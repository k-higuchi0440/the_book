# the book (Rust Programming Language)

I read The **[Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)**(so called "the book") and wrote some programs in the book. (but it is not exactlly the same. I sometimes tried to write code differently. so this package structure is different from one of the book).

FYI: it is a really good book to start Rust.
